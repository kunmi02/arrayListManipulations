In this repository I have tried to ilustrate the classes which are creating ArrayList with random integers, using two constructors: default constructor taking advantage of private variables and constructor which takes arguments and overrides  private variables with those arguments while creating ArrayList. ArraysData class utilizes also the setters and getters via consructors.

ArrayController is a class with static methods which are able to manipulate Arrays. Combining arrays into one 2D and finding the largest number of those two arrays.
